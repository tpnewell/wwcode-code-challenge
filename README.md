# wwcode-code-challenge
I'm participating in the Women Who Code Days of Code Challenge, and am tracking my progress and projects that I work on here.
Throughout the challenge I am focusing on several different areas, but have a main emphasis on web development and accessibility. My goal is to devote 100 days of learning to this project, and have some fun!
