# wwcode-code-challenge
I'm participated in the Women Who Code Days of Code Challenge, and am compiling the projects that I worked on through here.\
Throughout the challenge I focused on several different areas, but had a main emphasis on web development and accessibility. I successfully completed my goal of 30 days of coding and learning, and had some fun!
